# Crypto App
Setting up Xcode Project and custom color theme || SwiftUI Crypto App.
There are many techniques to adding a color scheme in your application, but I have found this to be one of the most efficient. By adding a Color extension, we can then use our custom colors across our entire app and have the ability to change the color theme at any time.



## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  npm install my-project
  cd my-project
```
